### R1D7
Revisiting OOP concepts for Ruby. Excited to see what's  next! Had a little headache but I managed to do my 1 hour. Consistency!
I think the secret is going slow but steady.

### R1D8
Studied a little bit more of OOP and a bit of Ruby story. Also checked some cool Ruby open source projects that I may contribute in the future!

### R1D9
I'm a little bit sick. Revised OOP concepts for half an hour and now I'm going to rest. Hope to be better tomorrow.

### R1D10
Just completed my 10th day of #100DaysOfCode! (R1D10)
I did some OOP exercises and read the Ruby Style Guide to get used with good Ruby code.
It is an acomplishment to me to be able to do this for 10 days. I hope that I can finish the 100 days!
